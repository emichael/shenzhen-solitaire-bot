SHENZHEN I/O Solitaire Bot
==========================

This is a bot for the solitaire game in Zachtronics's
[SHENZHEN I/O](http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/). Because this solitaire
variant is full-information and deterministic, the bot can use a
straight-forward search algorithm (with an admittedly simple heuristic).

## Requirements

To install all dependencies, simply execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Limitations

I have only tested this bot on Windows 10 at 1920x1080 resolution (with the game
open on my primary monitor). It is highly unlikely to work at other resolutions,
and there may be issues with other operating systems.
